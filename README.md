# Project-EDA-AMR-Prediction-Klebsiella-Genomics
The project aims to analyze genomic data to find patterns and understand antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Klebsiella pneumoniae through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning (ML) prediction models, with a specific focus on studying data from Pakistan to better understand local AMR trends.


**Background**

- **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR):** A major global health threat, leading to treatment failures and increased mortality. Emerges when bacteria evolve mechanisms to resist the effects of antibiotics.
- **Klebsiella pneumoniae:** A significant pathogen responsible for hospital-acquired infections like pneumonia, bloodstream infections, and UTIs. Known for rapidly acquiring and spreading resistance genes.
- **Meropenem Resistance:** Carbapenem antibiotics, like meropenem, are last-resort drugs for treating multi-drug-resistant infections. Resistance to meropenem poses a critical challenge in treating Klebsiella pneumoniae infections.
- **Genomic Data Analysis:** Whole-genome sequencing provides insights into resistance mechanisms and gene patterns. Offers opportunities for identifying novel resistance markers.
- **Machine Learning in AMR Prediction:** Enables pattern recognition in large datasets, enhancing prediction accuracy for resistance phenotypes. Helps in tailoring antibiotic usage and developing targeted interventions.
- **Focus on Pakistan:** Limited research on AMR patterns in the region despite a high burden of antibiotic misuse. Understanding local resistance trends is essential for effective healthcare strategies.
